# HackBout-Plant-Disease-Recognition
This is a neural network model for recognising the disease a plant has my taking input of the infected leaf.The conccept of transfer learning 
was used for making this model using keras.VGG16 model has been used for making this model.VGG16 (also called OxfordNet) is a convolutional
neural network architecture named after the Visual Geometry Group from Oxford, who developed it. It was used to win the ILSVR (ImageNet) 
competition in 2014.We added four additional layers for increasing accuracy.The model has been trained on google colab.
We have used flask as the server side language .MapMyAPI has been used to give the  location of nearby fertilizer shops.
